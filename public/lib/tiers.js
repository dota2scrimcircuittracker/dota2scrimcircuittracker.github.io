// In-season player tier list, from game stats alone.
//
//   score = stat points × survival × consistency × opponent strength × winning
//
//   role      Position 1–5 from the parsed replay (OpenDota's estimate); 1–3 are cores,
//             4–5 supports. Games without one (screenshot uploads, scrims) fall back to net
//             worth rank within the team. Each game is scored in the role played in it; a
//             player's listed role is the one they played most.
//   stat z    Each game, every stat is a z-score against the same position (a pos 3 is compared
//             with pos 3s), capped at ±Z_CAP, flipped for stats where less is better. GPM and
//             net worth are compared with what that position gets in a game that long (a
//             straight-line fit on game length), since both climb as games go on.
//   stat 0–100  A player's average z for each stat in a role, padded with K_SHRINK games at the
//             position average (so 3 lucky games don't read as a season). Then each stat is put on
//             its own 0–100 per role: 100 = the best such average of any player with MIN_GAMES+
//             games in that role, 0 = the worst. Capped to 0–100.
//   stat points  Each stat is worth a fixed number of points (WEIGHTS, 100 per role) and earns
//             its 0–100 as a percentage of them. No base or offset.
//   survival  Deaths, time dead and hero damage taken per life, each on its own 0–100 the same
//             way, weighted (SURVIVAL) into one 0–100 -> × 0.85 to × 1.00 on the stat points.
//   consistency  The spread (sd) of a player's series stat points, pulled toward the pool's
//             typical spread by K_CONSISTENCY series; the steadiest player sets 100, the
//             streakiest 0 -> × 0.90 to × 1.00.
//   opponents Each game's opponent: their game win % outside games against this player's team,
//             shrunk toward 50% by K_PRIOR even games. 25% -> × 0.90, 50% -> × 1.00,
//             75% -> × 1.10. Each series takes its games' average, and the season multiplier
//             weights series by their stat points, so the per-series scores average to the score.
//   winning   Win rate shrunk toward 50% by K_PRIOR even games, 25% -> 0, 75% -> 100; win speed:
//             each win scores the share of the pool's wins that took longer, shrunk toward 50
//             by K_SPEED wins. Two parts win rate to one part speed -> × 0.70 to × 1.30.
//   rating    The score through a normal curve fitted to the pool: the median player rates 50,
//             and the spread is RATING_STRETCH × the pool's standard deviation. Tiers by fixed
//             rating cutoffs.
//
// Farm, damage, building damage, XP, kills and assists are shares of the team's total, which
// don't grow with game length the way per-minute numbers do.
//
// The reference (per-position means, anchors, win lengths, consistency spread, curve) comes
// from the league itself: each AD2L division, or the scrim ledger, is scored against its own
// games (tierModel on them; the Heroic A/B views pass the whole division's model). Ratings
// compare players within a league, not across leagues.
